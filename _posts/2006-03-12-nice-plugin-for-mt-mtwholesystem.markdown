![關於MT的技術](http://www.evanlin.com/mt/images/mt-logo.gif)

[David Raynes](http://www.rayners.org/) has release a good plugin which name is "[MTWholeSystem](http://www.rayners.org/2003/01/mtwholesystem.php)". Use this plugin you can easy to build a index blog for all blogs in your system. 

There is a [chinese edition](http://blog.iyi.cn/hily/archives/2005/05/windowsiismt2661.htm) which has told you how to use this blog. This blog also introduce other interesting plugins.

By the way, I need some plugin look like this one, ut should be classify by every categories. Maybe I should modify "[MTWholeSystem](http://www.rayners.org/2003/01/mtwholesystem.php)" to make a new one for this.
