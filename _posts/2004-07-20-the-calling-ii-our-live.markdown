Our Lives

>     Is it love tonight
>     When everyone's dreaming
>     Of a better life
>     In this world
>     Divided by fear
>     We've gotta believe that
>     There's a reason we're here
>     Yeah, there's a reason we're here
>     
>     Cause these are the days worth living
>     These are the years we're given
>     And these are the moments
>     These are the times
>     Let's make the best out of our lives
>     
>     See the truth all around
>     Our faith can be broken
>     And our hands can be bound
>     But open our hearts and fill up the emptiness
>     With nothing to stop us
>     Is it not worth the risk?
>     Yeah, is it not worth the risk?
>     
>     Cause these are the days worth living
>     These are the years we're given
>     And these are the moments
>     These are the times
>     Let's make the best out of our lives
>     Even if hope was shattered
>     I know it wouldn't matter
>     Cause these are the moments
>     These are the times
>     Let's make the best out of our lives
>     
>     We can't go on
>     Thinking it's wrong
>     To speak our minds
>     I've gotta let out what's inside
>     
>     Is it love tonight
>     When everyone's dreaming
>     Can we get it right?
>     Yeah, well can we get it right?

>     These are the times
>     Let's make the best out of our lives
>     Even if hope was shattered
>     I know it wouldn't matter
>     Because these are the moments
