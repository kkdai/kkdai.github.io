## Start Docker Swarm Mode

Docker Swarm Mode is specific for Docker Swarm Version 2 which only enable after Docker 1.12. It is cluster management system for Docker.

## Install Docker-Machine:

Better to prepare at least 3 `docker-machine` for swarm node.

If you use `Docker for Mac` or `Docker for Windows` beta, you still need install `docker-machine.

- Install `docker-machine`:

```
curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.7.0/docker-machine-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-machine && \
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
```

## Run Docker Swarm
	
### Start to create 3 docker machine for cluster management.

```
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox v1
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox v2
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox v3
```

### Init cluster leader in v1

```
docker-machine ssh v1
```

For example if your v1 node IP address is `192.168.99.110`.

```
docker swarm init --listen-addr 192.168.99.110:2377 --advertise-addr 192.168.99.110
```

### Init Other Worker Node v2, v3

Let `v2`, `v3` join cluster as nodes.

Login and Control `v2`.

```
docker-machine ssh v2
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3h0ndq6j0agkl1inb7sd9gnrk1va4e0sggw74jsaj7xkx75c7n-31coul06qcdb7g411ww8jnurw 192.168.99.110:2377

> This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```

Login and Control `v3`.

```
docker-machine ssh v2

docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3h0ndq6j0agkl1inb7sd9gnrk1va4e0sggw74jsaj7xkx75c7n-31coul06qcdb7g411ww8jnurw 192.168.99.110:2377

> This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```

### Start Create Service in Swarm Mode.

```
docker-machine ssh v1
docker service create --name vote -p 8080:80 instavote/vote
```
### Check service if exist

```
docker service ls

ID            NAME  REPLICAS  IMAGE           COMMAND
7lwioo4526w7  vote  1/1       instavote/vote
```

### Check service if exist

```
docker service ps vote


ID                         NAME    IMAGE           NODE  DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE            ERROR
2peq9y4gv2ba3tijnp5vnfuj5  vote.1  instavote/vote  v1    Running        Running 11 minutes ago
b2qpn2e5xhy6hjdvelxjpqt74  vote.2  instavote/vote  v2    Shutdown       Shutdown 21 seconds ago
cjnd7rq37ldmvoq0id8tba7hp  vote.3  instavote/vote  v2    Shutdown       Shutdown 21 seconds ago
```

### Scale it

```
docker service scale vote=3
```

You will see every service will allocate one service.  

```
docker service ps vote

ID                         NAME        IMAGE           NODE  DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE                ERROR
2peq9y4gv2ba3tijnp5vnfuj5  vote.1      instavote/vote  v1    Running        Running 13 minutes ago
4x5kihy8z89mj9u2vyne2x3ec  vote.2      instavote/vote  v2    Running        Running 8 seconds ago
9ins324mae19gpzsli925ivtr  vote.3      instavote/vote  v3    Running        Preparing 11 seconds ago
```

If you try to reload it, the container ID will change. It is `Load Balancer` support for `docker swarm`.


### Service Update

```
docker service update --image instavote/vote:movies vote

docker service ls

ID            NAME  REPLICAS  IMAGE                 COMMAND
7lwioo4526w7  vote  2/3       instavote/vote:movies
```

### Rolling Update

```
docker service update vote --image instavote/vote:movies --update-parallelism 2 --update-delay 10s
```

Rolling update at most two server, once delay 10 seconds.

### Global Service

```
docker service create --mode=global --name prometheus prom/prometheus
```


### Fault Tolerance**

You can shutdown any server node, it will auto recover scale to other remain servers.


### Note: If you don't include `secret` and `--ca-hash` when worker join to master. The `Routing Mesh` doesn't work correctly.

## New Feature in Docker Swarm Mode

### Routing Mesh

Once you one a service in any one node in this cluster, you can connect to any node to get your service.

ex:

Assume you have three machine `v1` is leader and `v2`, `v3`, `v4` is worker node.

```
docker service create --name vote -p 8080:80 instavote/vote
docker service tasks vote
```

Once your create a `8080` port service in this cluster. **All nodes will listen `8080` port for this service**.

No Matter Docker Swarm arrange which node to run vote sercice (on `v2`, `v3` or `v4`.)

You can call any node to get this service. 

```
http://v1:8080
http://v2:8080
http://v3:8080
http://v4:8080
```

The worker node will use `gossip` protocol to ask all relevant node to retrieval correct node and response directly.

### Built-in Load Balancer

**Built-in layer 4 load balancing service**. 

For example:

- If you have node `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, `v4`
- Run and Scale vote to 4 `docker service scale vote=4`
- Once you connect to any node, the container ID will change. (Auto Load Balancer)

## Note for Docker 1.12 GM version:

- After Docker 1.12 RC to 1.12 GM version, there is no need for start a service. All service will auto start after your create it. (No `docker service task $SERVICE` )
- If you have multiple network card, you might need specific `--advertise-addr ` when your init docker swarm leader.

## Under the hood

### Swarm Mode Flow:

- Manager: `docker swarm init --listen-address=xxxx`
	- Create TLS Root key CA
- Worker: `docker swarm join xxx`
	- Manager create new key-pair for this worker
	- Key-pair signed bu Root CA
	- Deliver key to worker via TLS

### Role and Responsibility

- Manager:
	- Response for orchestration
	- Create TLS Root CA
	- Perform health-check for each worker
	- Using `Raft` consensus algorithm to sync status and command betwen managers.
	- Using memory to storage all data, no extra K-V DB.
- Worker:
	- Using `Gossip` for job detribution speed up worker node communication.
