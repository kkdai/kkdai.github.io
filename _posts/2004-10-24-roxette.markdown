**Roxette**

最近開始都在聽她們的歌曲, 她們那個時候有很多歌曲, 不論是編曲, 作曲, 到了現在都還是一等一的. 而我最喜歡她們的歌曲, 就是這首 Dangerous... 很輕快, 讓人家一聽就會有在郊外吹著風的感覺....

<blockquote>Dangerous
> 
> You pack your bag.  You take control.    
You're moving into my heart and into my soul.  
Get out of my way!  Get out of my sight!   
 I won't be walking on thin ice to get  
through the night.  
Hey, where's your work?  What's your game?    
I know your business but I don't  
know your name...
> 
> Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerors.    
She's got what it takes to make ends meet the eyes   
of a lover that hit like heat.    
You know she's a little bit dangerous.  
You turn around, so hot and dry.    
You're hiding under a holo, your mouth is alive.  
Get out of my way!  Get out of my sight!    
I'm not attracted to go-go deeper tonight.
> 
> Hey, what's your word?  What's your game?    
I know your business but I don't know your name...  
Hold on tight...  
She's armed and she's extremely dangerous...
