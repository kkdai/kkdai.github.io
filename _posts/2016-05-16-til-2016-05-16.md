## Major problem: 

System environment variable GOBIN cause problem "vim-go error: vim-go: goimports does not support srcdir"


## Situation:

Recently I use [vs code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go) to write golang more than `vim-go`，But when you upgrade the Golang version then use `vim-go` to save file, it will always popup following error message.

```
vim-go: goimports does not support srcdir
```


### Problem Environment:

- Mac Only.
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed only.


## Root Cause:

normally there are two importnt variable in `go env` which was `$GOPATH` and `$GOBIN`. But most user only set `$GOPATH` but `$GOBIN`.


It will cause your all golang binary install via  `go install` to the directory `$GOPATH/bin`.

Recently `Homebrew` formula, it will help us to set `$GOBIN` but the path will be`/usr/local/Cellar/go/GO_VERSION/libexec/bin` rather than `$GOPATH/bin`.


What's the problem with that？

1. If you have any package which force to install in  `$GOPATH/bin`, it might has problem with duplicate or not install latest one with Golang update.  [dlv](https://github.com/derekparker/delve) has the same issue before，[I file a PR for this](https://github.com/derekparker/delve/pull/504)．
2. If you already install some useful tool in `$GOPATH/bin` before, it will not update and some problem will occur. As my problem in `goimports` which is identical with [issue 775](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/issues/775), I use the old version of `goimports` so it will occur error in `vim-go`.)


## Solution:

- Remove all binary file `$GOPATH/bin`. (If you always use Homebrew for Golang update)
- Reinstall all binaries, it will install to correct path in `$GOBIN`, not `$GOPATH/bin`.
