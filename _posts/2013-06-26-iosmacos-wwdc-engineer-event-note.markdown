Keep note after I watch related event video of WWDC 2013.  
Just some my summary and my understanding here.






  * [Mac OSX Server](http://www.apple.com/osx/server/) become more important:



    * I believe OS Server version become more and more important when [Xcode 5](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/whats-new.html) launch. Note something I am very excited about: 



      * "Bot for continues integration": Great tool, no need to build a [BuildBot](http://trac.buildbot.net/) your self.


      * "Test Navigator": Quick for debugging for unit test.


      * "Automatic configuration":  Oh! no need for lots of setting when you trying to setup iCloud code.


      * "Source Control": Migrate it deeply, should be easy to used. But everyone has his own SCS why I switch to this one?






  * [iOS7](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios7/features/) is much big change than flat design:



    * When everyone keep focus on the flat design, but no one take  a look some interesting thing as follows:



      * "Multiple Tasking": No only multiple tasking but also power safe. How to do that? Apple just change the app on background work rule. Also add some API about background transfer (as I know lots of engineer use GPS to wake up your app on background transfer).  



        * The new background fetch become more smart and easy to use, it could detect user behavior to make sure power effective.


        * Remote notification become complete message not only for short message to make sure user could read it smoothly.


        * Background network transfer is great to use when you try to retrieve some data from internet on background.



      * "Transition and Effect": Big change with flat design, Apple put more resource to present effect and transition.






Keep study…..
