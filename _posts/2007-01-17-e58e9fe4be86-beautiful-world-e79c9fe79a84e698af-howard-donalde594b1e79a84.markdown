昨天剛拿到[Take That](http://www.takethat.com/)的[Beautiful World 那張專輯](http://www.evanlin.com/blog/archives/000665.html)。

![](http://p0.p.pixnet.net/albums/userpics/0/8/19608/1164893734.jpg)

很開心的去仔細品嚐裡面的介紹與文案~~ 竟然看到一句話。

<blockquote>"開場曲《Reach Out》以及由**霍華演唱的專輯同名曲《Beautiful World**》以吉他搖滾襯  
上些許電子氣流，表現流暢熟男動感。"
> 
> </blockquote>

阿～~ 原來我最愛的"Beautiful World"是由[Howard Donald](http://www.take-that.co.uk/bandmembers/howard/index.html)所唱的。

![Howard the DJ](http://take-that.co.uk/bandmembers/howard/pictures/DJ_HD.jpg)

到也不是說他唱的不好~~ 只是他歌唱實力的進步~~ 已經讓我覺得跟[Gary Barlow](http://www.take-that.co.uk/bandmembers/gary/)一樣了~~他的歌唱實力已經大大的進步~ 並且讓人家驚艷~~引用一個網友的敘述如下。

<blockquote>我覺得是howard耶  
最近電視播出他們的演唱會現場裡頭  
never forget的副歌片段是howard唱的  
howard的歌聲雖然聽起來和gary有點像  
但是howard的聲線比較低一些，也有些悶悶的  
沒有gary的"滑"和偶而會秀出來的假音唱腔  
beautiful world裡主唱的部份也比較悶悶低吼的唱
> 
> 話說我覺得除了gary之外  
(因為他本來就比較會唱 XD)  
其他人的歌聲都進步了  
Mark以往的鴨子音還是可以磨出好歌喉的～  
現在的他們真的"會"唱歌  
而不是以前歌聲平平只求不走音的ktv路線  
(ex: babe & child)
> 
> 新專輯裡Howard的beautiful world  
和Mark的hold on和shine都非常不錯  
我還比較喜歡他們主唱的幾首呢  
反而以往Gary擅長的情歌我覺得好無聊喔  
(ex: I'd wait for life, aint no sense in love)
> 
> 喔對了我沒提到jason齁  
其實懷疑現在他還是只唱合音部份  
(我誤會了@@ wooden boat是他唱的  
以前沒聽過他主唱  唱得不錯耶＠＠)  
不過他是現在裡頭外型最有味道的吧  
patience mv裡的超帥熟男阿～～
> 
> 喔喔找到wiki的曲目主唱資料了  
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_World_%28Take_That_album%29](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_World_%28Take_That_album%29)  
往下拉看曲目部份  
beautiful world是howard唱的沒錯喔～

**1.Reach Out Lyrics  
  
**If our arms were reaching out   
if our words could only bridge the doubt   
will we lose this chance again?   
Strange roads with different signs   
Don't even know where we divide   
Are you my enemy or my friend?   
  
'Cause I don't know you   
and you don't know me   
it's the same sun rising   
we all just look to the sky   
if we try   
we can work it out somehow   
if you don't know me   
and I don't know you   
how can we be fighting   
we're all connected it's true   
reaching out   
it's only love that pulls us through.   
  
We all grieve in different ways   
If one tears could wash away the pain   
We're all free to have the faith we believe, yeah   
The world sleeps at different times   
With one turn your day is now my night   
We all live sharing the air that we breathe.   
  
Reaching out, reaching high   
Reaching out   
Touching me.   
  
If our arms were reaching out   
Il our words could only bridge the doubt.   
  
**2.Patience Lyrics**  
  
Just have a little patience,   
Still hurting from a love I lost,   
I'm feeling your frustration,   
but in any minute all the pain will stop,   
just hold me close inside your arms tonight,   
don't be to hard on my emotion.   
  
Cause I, need time,   
My heart is numb has no feeling   
So while I’m still healing   
Just try, and have a little patience   
  
I really wanna start over again   
I know you wanna be my salvation   
The one I can always depend   
I'll try to be strong, believe me I'm trying to move on   
Its complicated to understand me,   
  
Cause I, need time,   
My heart is numb has no feeling   
So while I'm still healing   
Just try, and have a little patience yeah   
Have a little patience yeah.   
  
Cause the scares run so deep,   
its been hard but I have to believe   
have a little patience   
have a little patience   
  
Cause I, need time,   
My heart is numb has no feeling   
So while I'm still healing   
Just try, and have a little patience   
Have a little patience   
  
My heart is numb has no feeling   
So while I'm still healing   
Just try, and have a little patience   
  
**3.****Beautiful World Lyrics**  
  
Here standing in the rain   
The sun has gone again and nothing's gonna change   
Time, I need a little time as you slip out of sight   
  
And nothing heals the pain   
  
And I know that it's you that's stopping me from falling   
Crashing down, losing ground til I see you again   
And you know...   
  
The sun will shine, and we will see there's nothing standing in our way   
Love will stand and never break   
Never thought this could be me   
Do you feel what I feel ?   
Everytime that you are near it's a beautiful world   
A beautiful world   
  
Words are hard to keep inside   
Even though I've tried, impossible to hide   
  
And you know that it's me that's stopping you from falling   
Crashing don, losing ground til I see you again   
And you know ...   
  
I'll be the stars guiding you   
I'll be the place that you hide   
I'd run a thousand miles, a thousand miles to be by your side  
  
**4.Hold On Lyrics**  
  
We've been here many times before   
Leaving rooms and slamming doors   
We're climbing up the bedroom walls   
Sometimes we make it so frustrating   
I touch your mouth, I touch your lips   
The answers at our fingertips   
Not giving up or givin in   
Why are we so complicated?   
  
Oh tell me what to say, tell me   
To make it all ok   
  
I don't wanna se you Hurting   
Just hold on   
Just hold on to me   
I don't wanna se you crying   
Just hold on   
Just hold on to me   
  
I'm tryin' to think of what to do   
To really make it up to you   
So many truths, too many lies   
Making love can be so crazy   
I find myself back here again   
Asking you to let me in   
You know it's time, we need to change   
How can we live with all these maybes?   
  
There are no words to say, no words   
To make it go away   
  
I don't wanna se you Hurting   
Just hold on   
Just hold on to me   
I don't wanna se you crying   
Just hold on   
Just hold on to me   
  
Cause baby it's alright   
I'm staying here tonight   
So hold on   
  
Just tell me what to say   
To let you know I'll always stay   
  
I don't wanna se you Hurting   
Just hold on   
Just hold on to me   
I don't wanna se you crying   
Just hold on   
Just hold on to me   
  
**5.Like I Never Loved You At All Lyrics**  
  
Like I Never Loved You At All   
Where, where are the stars?   
The one that we used to call ours   
Can't imagine it now   
We used to laugh til we fell down.   
  
The secrets we had, are now in the past   
From something to nothing, tell me.   
  
How did we lose our way?   
It's hard to remember   
All that we shared   
Now we both have separate lives   
From lovers to strangers, now alone   
There's no one catching my fall   
No one to hear my call   
It's like I never loved you at all.   
  
Now you're so far away   
And I see our star is fading   
One too many times   
Guess it just got tired of waiting around.   
  
The nights that we though, if these walls could talk   
From something to nothing, tell me.   
  
So now does he give you love   
Is it only me now that's thinking of, what we had and what we were   
Did you ever care, baby was I ever there?   
  
**6.Shine Lyrics  
**  
You, you're such a big star to me   
You're everything I wanna be   
But you're stuck in a hole and I want you to get out   
I don't know what there is to see   
But I know it's time for you to leave   
We're all just pushing along   
Trying to figure it out, out, out.   
  
All your anticipation pulls you down   
When you can have it all, you can have it all.   
  
So come on, so come on, get it on   
Don't know what you're waiting for   
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey   
So come on   
See the light on your face   
Let it shine   
Just let it shine   
Let it shine.   
  
Stop being so hard on yourself   
It's not good for your health   
I know that you can change   
So clear your head and come round   
You only have to open your eyes   
You might just get a big surprise   
And it may feel good and you might want to smile, smile, smile.   
  
Don't you let your demons pull you down   
'Cause you can have it all, you can have it all.   
  
Hey let me know you   
You're all that matters to me   
Hey let me show you   
You're all that matters to me.   
  
Hey let me love you   
You're all that matters to me   
Hey so come on yeah   
Shine all your light over me.   
  
**7.I'd Wait For Life Lyrics  
**  
There's a place we used to be   
There's a face that I used to see   
There's a picture with you by my side   
There's a moment that I want to find.   
  
I don't know where to start   
Or how to begin   
But I know I love you still.   
  
If you ever turn away   
If you ever change your mind   
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
  
If there's something in you heart that tells you to stop   
Oh to hold you close tonight   
I'd wait for life.   
  
There's a voice shouting inside my head   
There's a space on your side of the bed   
There's a hope everytimes there’s a sound   
There's a silence that’s playing too loud.   
  
I don't know how you are   
Or how you may be   
But I know I love you still.   
  
If I close my eyes   
I'll dream a little deeper baby   
'Cause you are always on my mind   
yeah you are always on my mind   
For life   
  
**8.A'int No Sense In Love Lyrics  
**  
I'm afraid of the mornig   
I'm afraid of the light   
You should come with a warnig   
You should be wearing a sign   
That says you're beautiful trouble   
So you better beware   
One look and I was in right over my head.   
  
On this misery   
There's no place on earth I'd rather be.   
  
You're not the one I need   
You're just the one that I want   
Makes perfect sense to me   
You're not the one I need   
But you're the one that I want   
Ain’t no sense in love.   
  
I try to stop myself   
So many times   
But I keep falling over   
I keep crossing the line   
The heart of a gypsy and the soul of a stone   
It's just a matter of time before you leave me alone.   
  
Oh sweet misery   
Fill my heart un and pour it all over me.   
  
It's not logical   
That's the way I feel   
It's not logical   
Psychological   
It's heaven underneath my skin but it’s hell out here.   
  
**9.Why You Believe In Lyrics**  
  
What am I to you and what are you to me?   
Are we getting better or did we used to be?   
What of the songs we used to sing?   
Where are the souls we used to carry in?   
What is a sail without a hurrycane?   
What is a hurt without someone to blame?   
Show me the sky and I'll climb the stairs   
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.   
  
Give me what it is you believe in   
'Cause I give to you my truth   
I got all my faith in you   
I don't know which way we are going   
Doesn't matter anyway   
Just as long as you will stay.   
  
Tell me the word and I'll shout in out   
For what is a voice when in doubt?   
The world has changed   
The world will change   
Oh give me something cause I need to feel.   
  
It's all good you know   
I still love you so   
And you don't have to do this on your own.   
  
**10.Mancunian Lyrics**  
  
We used to walk Mancunian Way   
We used to swagger we used to sway   
Up until the lights took us away   
Do you know what you meant to me?   
We used to think we werethe bomb   
Then someone left a real one   
We stayed indoors as the rain come   
Back than it made no sense to me   
I'm missing your face, your beautiful face   
It's funny that I recall they gave us the keys to the city,   
But they don't fit anything   
But I'm coming anyway.   
  
I hear you calling   
I came back running   
Forgot that feeling   
Been so long coming   
They tried to step her   
She just got stronger   
I'm driving home again   
Back down Mancunian Way.   
  
I just forgot how it is to feel   
To dance and move and keep it real   
Been lying down for ten long years   
But I was there and it feels like yesterday   
I'm missing your face, your beautiful face   
It's funny that recall you came when I was pretty, but that don't work no more   
But I'm coming anyway.   
  
Now I stand here in front of you   
I know now what I'm gonna do   
My shoulders low, but my head is high   
I'm gonna bring this town alive   
Through this acidic rain   
I'm gonna come back to life again.   
  
**11.Wooden Boat/Butterfly Lyrics  
  
**A little boy me went fishing in a wooden boat   
Sitting there for hours in the cold   
Patience is a virtue til we die   
Then a ripple in the water caught my eye   
  
Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for   
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor   
We go from green to blue to gold to black   
Breathe deep, who knows how long this will last   
  
Only was last week I learned to drive   
Stole my Mother's keys and drove all night   
Christine never showed it's 4am   
Started up Mum's car drove home again   
  
Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for   
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor   
We go from green to blue to gold to black   
Breathe deep, who knows how long this will last   
  
One year ago I kissed my bride   
Now I wait to hear my baby's cry   
Woman showed me all that she knew then   
To cut himself down man's born again   
  
Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for   
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor   
We go from green to blue to gold to black   
Breathe deep, who knows how long this will last   
  
Christine died and now I'm here alone   
What I wouldn't give to be on that wooden boat
