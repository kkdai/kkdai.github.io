### Symptom:

- Service/Pod could create success, but could not connect to pod.
- Could not connect to another pod in another node (even in the same node)
- All kubectl status works well
- Your docker is newer than 1.13 (it works well if your docker version is 1.12)

It will happen on "kubeadm" but not happen in "minikube".

### Diagnosis:

Check iptable rule.

```
sudo iptables-save

-A INPUT -j KUBE-FIREWALL
-A FORWARD -j DOCKER-ISOLATION
-A FORWARD -o docker0 -j DOCKER
-A FORWARD -o docker0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -
j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i docker0 ! -o docker0 -j DROP
-A FORWARD -i docker0 -o docker0 -j DROP
-A OUTPUT -j KUBE-FIREWALL
-A DOCKER-ISOLATION -j RETURN
```

As you could observe "A FORWARD -i docker0 ! -o docker0 -j `DROP`"


### Root cause:

Refer to moby issue [40182](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/40182) (still not resolve until kubernetes 1.8)

- [Docker 1.13 changed the default iptables forwarding policy to DROP](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/28257)
- So all forward traffic will be blocked by the default iptable forward rule.

### Solution:

1. Downgrade to docker v1.12.x
2. Add iptable forward rule to all (not suggest)
	- `sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT`
3. Start every container with `docker --iptables=false` (not easy when you use kubernetes)
