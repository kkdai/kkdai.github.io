## Difference between Chubby and Zookeeper

- Consensus Algorithm:
	- `Chubby`: Using `Paxos` consensus algorithm
	- `Zookeeper`: Using `ZAB` (which is a modified algorithm of `Paxos`)
- Access Path:
	- `Chubby`: Must through leader, follower don't accept any command directly.
	- `Zookeeper`: Can accept any command from all follower, but will go back to leader.
- Data Out-Of-Date:
	- `Chubby`: No rish on out-of-date, because all data fro Leader.
	- `Zookeeper`: Will get out-of-date data, if read without `sync` command. `Sync` command will force ask follower ask Leader first before return result to client.


## The tolerance of Quorum-Backup and Primary-Backup:

### Majority Quorums:

For `Paxos` or `ZAB`, A leader election need meet majority quorum ( n/2 +1 )	. It means if `n=2f` at most the service can tolerance `f` service failed at the same time. ( Quorum-Backup Replica ).

### Primary-Backup 

- All data must confirm by all follower confirmed.
- Much slower than "Quorum-Backup".

### Kafka ISR (In-Sync Replica)

`In-Sync Replica` is a backup policy which similar with Primary-Backup but in sychronous replication.

Server store two copy of replica data:

- ISR (The latest one) store in Leader. 
- Follower store replica data might later than ISR.
- Use `Zookeeper` to update all follower replica data from ISR.

In this case, if total server is `n=f+1`, we could tolerance number of `f` service failed. ( Primary-Backup replica )

**trade-off**: 

- Follower data critical late than leader, but in Kafka this case might be acceptable.
- If follower cannot catch up data from leader, will drop ISR by leader.
- If failed on leader, it has high possibility lost data if next leader. (Choose leader from non-ISR list, because all follower in ISR leave behind.)
- Use `Zookeeper` to store ISR will introduce split brain issue. (two majority group issue).
