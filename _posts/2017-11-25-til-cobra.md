[spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) is a great package if you want to write your own console app. Even [Kubernetes console](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd/kubectl) use `cobra` to develop it console app.

### Create simple CLI app example.

Let's use `kubectl` as simple example it support.

- `kubectl get nodes`
- `kubectl create -f ...RESOURCE`
- `kubectl delete -f ...RESOURCE`


### Create sub-command using Cobra

Take those command as an example, there are some sub-command as follow:

- `get`
- `create`
- `delete`

Here is how we add that sub-command to your app. (ex: `kctl`)

- `cobra init` in your repo. It will create `/cmd` and `main.go`.
- `cobra add get` to add sub-command get
    - now, you can try `kctl get` to get prompt from the console which you already call this sub-command.
- Repeatedly for `create` and `delete`. You will see related help in `kctl --help`.

### Add nested-command using Cobra

Cobra could use console mode to add sub-command, but you need to add nested command manually.

ex: we need add one for `kctl get nodes`.

- Add `nodes.go` in `/cmd`
- Add following code as an example.

```
package cmd

import (
  "fmt"

  "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

func init() {
  getCmd.AddCommand(nodesCmd)
}

var nodesCmd = &cobra.Command{
  Use:   "nodes",
  Short: "Print the nodes info",
  Long:  `All software has versions. This is Hugo's`,
  Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
    fmt.Println("get nodes is call")
  },
}
```

- The most important you need `getCmd.AddCommand(nodesCmd)`.
