## Preface

When I first take a look about [fisherman](http://fisherman.sh/), I got lots of interesting to change my shell from `bash` to `fish`

## How to Change to Fish (shell)


### Install Fish shell

```
brew install fish
```

### Change it to default shell

```
//Add fish shell into known shell list
sudo -s 
echo /usr/local/bin/fish >> /etc/shells

//back to original user
//change default shell to fish
exit
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
```

## Suggestion a good plugin for Fisherman?

```
## My suggest plugin for fisherman
fisher omf/theme-bobthefish

# ~   master *…  Documents/ 
```

## Ops, Why my all configurations missing?

You might occur all the `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.bashrc` setting missing in `fish`. 

### Here is guideline to change it

I got help from [@jbucaran](https://twitter.com/jbucaran), here is his guildline.


#### 1. Convert aliases into functions to opt in fish autoloading, tl;dr alias is slow, functions are fast.

For example:

```
function vi
     vim $argv
end

```

#### 2. For export, use set -x

For example:

```
//setup GOPATH
set -x GOPATH $HOME/src/go

//Extend your PATH
set -x PATH $PATH $GOBIN
```

Note: 

```
//bash setting
export GOROOT=`go env GOROOT`

//change to fish
set -x GOROOT (go env GOROOT)
```

More detail, feel free to check this [gist](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/18ff3b8e39fc47eb8644).

## Let use "fisherman"

"fisherman" is fish plugin manager, which is powerful and useful. Check [here](http://fisherman.sh/) for more detail.

```
curl -sL get.fisherman.sh | fish
```


### Any problem? How to change it back?

Don't worry, just use `chsh` to change it back.

```
chsh -s /bin/bash
```
