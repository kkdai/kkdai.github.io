# Tensorflow Dev Summit Recap

## Keynote:

* TF Goal:
    * to introduce ML to everyone
* TF feature:
    * Scalable 
    * Performance
* Widely usage for TF
* Multiple device for TF 
    * TPU
        * ASIC
        * 10x faster
* TF for everyone
    * TF for form
    * Fried Chicken Nugget Server
    * TensorKart
    * Generative Arts with TensorFlow
    * TV popstar face generator with DCGAN
    * TF for qualcomm’s Hexagon DSP
    * Konpeki [https://aucnet-ibs.com/konpeki/2016/09/29/konpeki.html](https://aucnet-ibs.com/konpeki/2016/09/29/konpeki.html)
* TF 1.0
    * Feature:
        * Fast 
        * Flexible
        * Product-Ready
    * More ML
        * K-means
        * SVM
        * Random Forest 

## XLA

* What is XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra)
    * JIT Complication
    * JIT
        * Program built at runtime
        * Low-Overhead complication
    * TF-Level Block Diagram
* Why excited about XLA
    * Server-side speedups
    * XLA’s JIT compilation and specialization
    * Model-shaped benchmark wins up to 60%
    * SyntaxNet from 200us —> 5 us 
    * Mobile footprint reduction
    * Cross-compile for AMR, PPC, x86
    * LSTM model for mobile: 2.6 MB —> 600 KB (4x reduction)
    * XLA’s high-leve optimizer 
* Caveats:
    * Not all Ops compile
    * Not everything is faster
* JIT :
    * Improvement lot in GPU
    * But still WIP in CPU (slower when use CPU)

## TensorFlow High-Level API

* Original Tensorflow:
    * Flexible, 
    * Extensible, 
    * Maintainable
    * No Out-of-the-bix algorithm
* Fast Iteration
    * Estimator could  train, fit, predict for models.
* Encodes best practices
* Deploy with Tensorflow Serving
* Distribution 
* High Level API
    * Layer
    * Estimator (1.1)
    * Canned Estimator (1.2)
* Keras
    * tf.keras (1.2) tf.contrib.keras(1.1) 
    * tensorflow.layer and keras.layer is the same
    * run keras on tensorflow help keras user
        * Use distribution training
        * Cloud ML
        * Tensor Serving
* Wide & Deep Learning
    * memorization and generalization
    * Memorization:
        * Bird can fly
    * Generalization
        * Bird with wing can fly
