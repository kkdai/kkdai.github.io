##### What to Do When You Receive Duplicate Messages in Outlook Express

 

If you are accessing a POP account (this is most likely, and is the case if your email account is neither a Hotmail nor an IMAP account) and have set it to [keep mail on the server](http://email.about.com/od/outlookexpress/qt/et060703.htm), at least [for some time](http://email.about.com/od/outlookexpressbackuphelp/qt/et_server_copy.htm), the reason for the malaise may be a hiccup in the file that keeps track of the messages already downloaded. 

 

To fix the same messages coming from a POP account again and again: 

 

  
  * ›› [Step by Step Screenshot Walkthrough](http://email.about.com/od/stepbystepwalkthroughs/ss/wt_duplicates.htm)
    
  * [Open your Outlook Express store folder in Windows Explorer](http://email.about.com/cs/oetipstricks/qt/et101202.htm). 
   
  * Click on the file named "Pop3uidl.dbx" with the right mouse button. 
   
  * Select _Delete_ from the menu. 
 

Since Outlook Express has just lost even the rest memory of which mail it has already seen, expect _all_ mail still on the server to be retrieve the next time you click _Send/Recv_. After that, mail retrieve should return to normal, however. 

 

All duplicates already received can be eliminated fast with a [duplicate removal tool](http://email.about.com/od/removeduplicates/).
