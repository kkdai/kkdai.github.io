## Python2 (opencv2) with Homebrew

Python 2

- `brew install python`
- `brew install opencv`
- `python`

```
>>> import cv2
```

## Python3 (opencv3) with Homebrew and PIP

Python3

- `brew install python3`
- `brew uninstall opencv3	`
- `brew install opencv3 --without-python --with-python3`
- `echo /usr/local/opt/opencv3/lib/python3.6/site-packages >> /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/opencv3.pth`
- `python3`

```
>>> import cv2
```

## Install dlib (only for Python3)

[dlib](http://dlib.net/) is very useful for face detection machine learning, but it is hard to install on mac osx with python. [compile issue](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/issues/162)  and [compile issue2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38156075/compiling-dlib-on-os-x)

I got some script from this, but still not working for me.

#### Using PIP3 to install dlib for python3

- Install boost for python3 but not for python2
  - `brew install boost-python --with-python3 --without-python`
- `pip3 install dlib`
- `python3`

```
>>> import dlib
```
