### Original Video:[Slack: Real-Time Communication with HAProxy and Route53 on AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkYSiNTE-0U&feature=youtu.be)


## Preface:

Original video comes from AWS "My Architect", it introduce how slack to build their service on top of AWS.  

This video is very easy to understand within 5 minutes, it make me to think about - Could we use this video to think about how to build slack-like service from scratch?

原始影片是在講解如何透過 AWS 的服務來架設 Slack ，不過裡面有許多思考脈絡很適合去思考 ”如何架設一個類似 Slack 的架構"． 
這邊很歡迎大家去看原始影片，只要 05:43 而已，但是裡面有許多細節可以提供我們慢慢地思考．

## Disclaimer

This article just made by me which to think about how to make a slack-like service from scratch. It not offical slack report or documentation here. Every ideas are just my assumptions. 

Feel free to correct me once you find anything is wrong. :)


##  How to build slack-like service from scratch? (from my point of view)

###  From beginning

Slack is a "online messaging service", so if we want to build something like slack. Your choice might be 

- xmpp
- webRTC (not only online messaging, but also video/audio streaming)
- Or we could build something just using websocket?

user use "websocket" to connect server and communicate with each other.

So, the basic architecture is very simple.

`user -> websocket -> server <- websocket <- user`

### Challenge 1: More users

When the lots of user come-in use your slack-like sytem, you have to build a HAPROXY to load-balance your websocket connection.

`user -> websocket -> HAPROXY -> server(s) <- HAPROXY <- websocket <- user`

### Challenge 2: Need sercurity of your transmission.

You need a way to protect the trasmission between each server. In that way, you might need [IPSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) to increase your transmission security.

`user -> websocket -> HAPROXY -> server <- IPSEC -> server <- HAPROXY <- websocket <- user`

### Challenge 3: Need reduce the huge amount request cause server heavy loading.

Although we using the HAPROXY to do load-balancing of websocket request, but if too much user it will have huge amount of database access connection and access request to server. 

It have following problems(challenges):

- Start connection take too long and expensive
- Client data footprint become large for mobile user
- Reconnection storm are resource intensive

How could we try to optimize it? Slace have their own edge-cache system which call "Flannel" (Application-level edge cache)

(without Flannel)

(with Flannel)

"[Flannel](https://slack.engineering/flannel-an-application-level-edge-cache-to-make-slack-scale-b8a6400e2f6b)" provide following features:

- Keep persistent connection with server but provide slimmed down version client side data to client.
- So, client don't need handle huge connection bootstrape data instead of using few data with flannel.
- Provide a lazily load from client side
- Reduce mobile user connection waiting time and data size.

EX: Client side will connect to flannel for "auto-complete" result from "at"(@) someone.


`user -> websocket -> HAPROXY -> Flannel -> server <- IPSEC -> server <- Flannel <- HAPROXY <- websocket <- user`

### Challenge 4: Large pre-load message

When client is login after long-time, it might need take full bootstrape login process. It will also to retrival all up-to-date information to keep your slack channel data. 

In that way, user will connect to `slack-like.com` to retrieval related data. In other way, we also need DNS server to serve huge domain name translation service.

"[AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/route53/)" is AWS DNS service, it also provide HTPROXY health check to make sure every load balancer works well.


`(Offline data sync)    Client -> Route 53 --> HAPROXY -> Flannel...`					
															
### Question: Why use HAPROXY and ELB in the same system?

Mobile user and some use case need slimmed down data transfer will go by HAPROXY with self-defined LB rule to "Flannel"

Other requests ("CloudFront") will use ELB.

## Wrap-up

This article just trying to build a slack-like service from scratch. Then, we trying to improvde our service when we have some new challenge here.

It is a good practice for me to think about whole architecture for realtime messaging service. Hope you enjoy it.
