## ETCD Architecture study.

Some study note about survey how Raft work in ETCD. Something more about official [architecture](https://coreos.com/fleet/docs/latest/architecture.html) from digging code.

- Data storage in [etcd/storage/backend](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/tree/0eeb663754e359db06ba52ded28ac871ad9c78b8/storage/backend). The file structure as follow:
	- topic/sub_topic/data
- Data Exchange type using protobuf with grpc

BTW: NSQ using [http.handle](https://github.com/nsqio/nsq/blob/master/nsqd/http.go). So, no RPC data exchange issue, no protobuf required.

## NSQ about how to elimiate SPOF

Refer to [slide](http://www.slideshare.net/guregu/nsqcentric-architecture-gocon-autumn-2014). 

Seems the SPOF means of client side failure handle, not server side.  (TBC)


![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mf74lmYhZa1qj3yp2.png)

- Every server response to dedicate topic (no redudent) (p.22)
- Client use this to add more consumer and handle it as load balance. (Refer [topology_pattern](http://nsq.io/deployment/topology_patterns.html)) 
	- quote: `Assuming you have some sort of load balancer in front of these two hosts you can now tolerate any single host failure.`

Need more check about this [gist](https://gist.github.com/bketelsen/a2d353d0318736c9fa23) about use NSQ on K8s
