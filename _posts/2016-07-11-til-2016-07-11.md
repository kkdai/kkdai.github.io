Using `docker-machine` is another way to host your google compute instance with docker.

```
docker-machine create \
  --driver google \
  --google-project $PROJECT \
  --google-zone asia-east1-c \
  --google-machine-type f1-micro $YOUR_INSTANCE
```

If you want to login this machine on google cloud compute instance, just use `docker-machine ssh $YOUR_INSTANCE`

Refer to [docker machine driver gce](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/gce/)

Note: 

-  The progress of `docker-machine` might be slow because it need connect to Google Compute Engine.
-  Do not use multiple `docker-machine` creation, because docker need to write related information on docker.sock. You might occur error on `Wrapper Docker Machine process exiting due to closed plugin server (unexpected EOF)`.
- Using `docker-machine` to create local vbox vm will install docker 1.12 rc1, but on GCP will using 1.11. So, we could use docker swarm mode :(
